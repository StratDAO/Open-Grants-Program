# W3F Open Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** StratDAO
- **Team Name:** StratDAO Dev Team
- **Payment Address:** 0xC85FFA237ba4F56e3440D7f193CA921d0D639AE8

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

StratDAO is aiming for yield strategy incubation based on community wisdom in Polkadot DeFi Ecosystem. We try to solve problems like low yield performance &  logy strategy updates in exsited yeild aggregators (YFI V2, AUTO, etc.). The key reason is that the participation of the whole DeFi community is not well inspired in these projects.

So we propose StratDAO to help DeFi participant to easily compose strategy with easy-to-use tools, interfaces and workflow templates. And all strategies will be reviewd, voted and listed by the open community.

### Overview

Core modules are as follows:

- Strategy Development SDK (intergrates and wraps core functions in Polkadot DeFi Projects).
- Front-End Visual Strategy Composing Tool
- Strategy Template Libary
- Governance Module
- Module of Modeling and Simulation for strategies  (TBD)

### Project Details

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
    - If so, how is your project different?
    - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We *recommend* that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. *Treat it as a contract*; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](https://www.notion.so/src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
- include the amount of funding requested *per milestone*.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone, and include the approximate number of days along with the cost per day.
- *Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory* and shall not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish under the terms of the license of the respective project and that you highlight this fact in your milestone documentation and in the source code if applicable! Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** Required workload of a full-time employee for the whole project (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent)) (e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Amount of payment in USD for the whole project. The total amount of funding *needs to be below $30k for initial grants* and $100k for follow-up grants. (e.g. 12,000 USD)

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:** 2
- **Costs:** 8,000 USD
