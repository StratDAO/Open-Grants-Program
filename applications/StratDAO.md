# W3F Open Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** StratDAO
- **Team Name:** StratDAO Dev Team
- **Payment Address:** 0xC85FFA237ba4F56e3440D7f193CA921d0D639AE8

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

StratDAO is aiming for yield strategy incubation based on community wisdom in Polkadot DeFi Ecosystem. We try to solve problems like low yield performance &  logy strategy updates in exsited yeild aggregators (YFI V2, AUTO, etc.). The key reason is that the participation of the whole DeFi community is not well inspired in these projects.

So we propose StratDAO to help DeFi participant to easily compose strategy with easy-to-use tools, interfaces and workflow templates. And all strategies will be reviewd, voted and listed by the open community.

### Overview

Core modules are as follows:

- Strategy Development SDK (intergrates and wraps core functions in Polkadot DeFi Projects).
- Front-End Visual Strategy Composing Tool
- Strategy Template Libary
- Governance Module
- Module of Modeling and Simulation for strategies  (TBD)

Essential supported functions include:

Yield Strategy Dev Toolset
Provide features like easy-to-use, visual and codeless, the module also include yield strategy contributor intensive mechanism. Funtions in other protocols supported like yield farming, liquidity mining, staking, portfolio, swap, lending...

Yield Management Module
Users of StratDAO can use the protocol for a high yield rate, and fees will be payed to strategy developers.

Leverage Module 
Like Alpha Homora in ethereum, we also provide leverage to enlarge returns for both users and strategy composer. 

DAO Module
Community will governance the whole strategies composed, and they deside which one are qualified to be listed as a valid one, we will also provide simulation and verification tools.



### Ecosystem Fit

* We are aiming to help the whole Poladot DeFi users to deliver their wisdom no matter he is skilling in programing or not.
* For Polkadot/Kusama DeFi protocols, we can boost their utilization and composability.
